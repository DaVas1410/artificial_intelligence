# Artificial-Intelligence
Solutions to projects in BerkeleyX: CS188.1x Artificial Intelligence

This was a free course offered at [edx.org](https://www.edx.org/) as an introduction to artificial intelligence. This repo contains solutions to the three projects assigned. Each project is showcased as a Pacman game where the student implements algorithms to win the game.

After cloning this repo, you can follow the links of each project to find in each project folder where the algorithms are implemented. All of the solutions are implemented by me and can be found under: "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***" of specific files.

You can also work through the problems yourself! The project description also shows you how to run various game simulations so you can see the AI algorithms in action before your very eyes :)

## Project 1 - Search

[Project 1 description](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa11/projects/search/search.html)

This project deals with search algorithms in AI. The implemented search algorithms will help Pacman traverse through the game board.

This project covers:
<ul>
<li>Depth First Search</li>
<li>Breadth First Search</li>
<li>Uniform Cost Search</li>
<li>A* Search</li>
<li>Heuristic Techniques</li>
</ul>

## Project 2 - Multi-Agent Pacman

[Project 2 description](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa11/projects/multiagent/multiagentProject.html)

This project deals with additional search problems but with multiple agents. In the previous project, Pacman was the only agent. In this project, we have Pacman and the ghosts as well! The main idea is that the search algorithms will take all of the agents into account instead of just Pacman.

This project covers:
<ul>
<li>Evaluation Functions</li>
<li>Minimax</li>
<li>Alpha Beta Pruning</li>
<li>Expectimax</li>
</ul>

## Project 3 - Reinforcement Learning

[Project 2 description](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa11/projects/reinforcement/reinforcement.html)

This project deals with different algorithms in reinforcement learning where an agent's action will be based on experience.

This project covers:  
<ul>
<li>Markov Decision Process</li>
<li>Value Iteration</li>
<li>Q-Learning</li>
<li>Approximate Q-Learning</li>
</ul>
